# Nexed Kanban
A Basic Kanban App for NexEd Long-Term Planning

For Bit Academy students, especially those in their first year, creating a long-term plan can be challenging. This app offers a simple Kanban system to help students organize and plan for long-term goals, such as achieving their VSA or BSA.
